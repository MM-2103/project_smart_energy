# Assignment Variant D - Project Smart Energy

Carry out the assignment according to the description below.  
The **"Basic"** section with the corresponding algorithm is mandatory and is the minimum requirement to complete this assignment. Make sure to work this out properly first.  

With only a well-developed basic version, you can already score a **"Good"** in the rubric.  
Everything under the **"Extra"** section can raise the level of your assignment; it is optional. By doing so, you demonstrate that you already have good programming skills and that you can independently enrich your knowledge, for example by learning new UI elements. This is certainly not expected of everyone yet, and thatâ€™s completely fine!  
**Priority should be on a well-developed basic version.**

## Context
Dynamic energy prices can help prevent grid congestion. Energy prices vary per hour.  
- If there is a lot of supply (e.g., on sunny days), the price is low.  
- If there is high demand but little supply, the price increases.  

By using energy at smart times, you can save money this way.

## Basic Requirements

- Add a web page to the project that can be accessed via a menu.  
- Ensure your name is displayed at the top of the web page.  
- Below this, show a description of the algorithm so the user understands how the result was generated.  
- Under the description, display the result of your analysis, including the parameters used (e.g., the time period over which the analysis was carried out).  

### The Algorithm
On your web page, show the cost analysis of your householdâ€™s electricity consumption **with and without dynamic tariffs**.  

- Over a user-defined time period (in days), calculate per day:  
  - the amount of energy consumed,  
  - the cost with a dynamic energy tariff, and  
  - the cost with a fixed kWh price.  
- The dynamic hourly tariffs are included in the provided data objects.  
- Add an input field on your webpage for the fixed price.  
  - A common fixed-price tariff is **â‚¬0.25 per kWh**.  

At the bottom of your analysis, show the **total consumption and costs** over the analyzed period.

## Extra (Optional)

Only look into these after your basic algorithm above is fully working!  
Optional extensions cannot turn an insufficient basic solution into a passing grade.  

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Before starting on the extras, make a copy of your work so you can always return to a working basic version.

- Allow analysis of multiple households using a selection field.  
- Calculate extra statistics, such as the variation in dynamic tariffs.  
- Display your analysis with clear and attractive graphics.  
- You are also free to make your own additions. If you do, make sure to explain in your blog why you added them.
